/**
 * Test suite for {@link CrossEntropyIndependenceTester}.
 *
 * <p>This class validates the statistical behaviour of the cross-entropy-based
 * independence tester used by the PC learning algorithm.
 * Rather than testing low-level numerical routines in isolation, these tests
 * exercise the tester in a more integrated way by:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>constructing a synthetic {@link CaseDatabase},</li>
 *   <li>creating the corresponding network variables and nodes,</li>
 *   <li>running the independence test on selected pairs of variables, and</li>
 *   <li>checking whether the returned p-values agree with the expected
 *       probabilistic structure encoded in the synthetic data.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The database used in this class is intentionally designed to represent
 * the following causal pattern:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     C
 *    / \
 *   A   B
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>That structure induces two key statistical properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Marginal dependence</b> between {@code A} and {@code B}, because
 *       both variables are influenced by the common cause {@code C}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Conditional independence</b> between {@code A} and {@code B}
 *       given {@code C}, because once the value of {@code C} is fixed,
 *       the remaining association between {@code A} and {@code B} disappears.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These properties make the dataset particularly suitable for validating
 * the intended semantics of the tester. If the implementation is correct,
 * it should return:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a <b>small p-value</b> when testing marginal independence between
 *       {@code A} and {@code B}, indicating dependence, and</li>
 *   <li>a <b>large p-value</b> when testing conditional independence
 *       between {@code A} and {@code B} given {@code C}, indicating that
 *       independence cannot be rejected.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These tests serve as functional regression checks for the statistical
 * interpretation of {@link CrossEntropyIndependenceTester#test(CaseDatabase, Node, Node, List)}.
 * In particular, they help detect:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>incorrect computation of conditional cross-entropy,</li>
 *   <li>incorrect conversion from cross-entropy to chi-square statistic,</li>
 *   <li>incorrect computation of degrees of freedom,</li>
 *   <li>confusion between chi-square CDF values and right-tail p-values, and</li>
 *   <li>unexpected changes in the behaviour of the independence tester after
 *       refactoring.</li>
 * </ul>

     * P(A=0 | C=0) = 0.8

     * P(A=0 | C=1) = 0.2
     * P(B=0 | C=1) = 0.2
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Within each fixed value of {@code C}, the frequencies are chosen as
     * products of the corresponding conditional probabilities, which induces
     * approximate conditional independence between {@code A} and {@code B}
     * given {@code C}. However, because the conditional distributions differ
     * strongly between {@code C = 0} and {@code C = 1}, the marginal
     * distribution of {@code (A,B)} still reflects dependence.
     *
     * <p>This is a standard and useful synthetic scenario for validating
     * conditional independence tests.
