/**
 * Capability interface for potentials that can be projected onto a partial evidence case to
 * produce a {@link TablePotential}.
 *
 * <p>Projection is the core operation of variable-elimination inference: given an evidence
 * assignment for some of the variables in the potential, it returns a new
 * {@code TablePotential} whose remaining variables are conditioned on that assignment.</p>
 *
 * <p>Not every {@link Potential} subclass supports projection (e.g. {@code FunctionPotential}
 * does not); only those that implement this interface are guaranteed to do so.
 * This eliminates the pattern of abstract methods that many subclasses satisfy with
 * {@code throw new UnsupportedOperationException()} or {@code return null}.</p>
